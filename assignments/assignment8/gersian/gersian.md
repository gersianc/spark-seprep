# Assignment 8

## Challenges I faced along the way
* At first I had an issue with podman and it was because I did not have it update therefore I didn't have the right provider type. I got help for this during OH (thank you!)
* So it worked at first but then I didn't have my own audio so I got my own audio then converted it to .wav and then that's when I ran into another issue of not being able to connect to the port, I fixed this by updating all my packages.
* Final challenge I faced was since it's been a week since I last had this running I was confused why it wasn't working and after 30 minutes I remembered that I have to deploy the model and run streamlit on 2 seperate terminals.

## My Audio
The audio I picked was of the basketball player LeBron James screaming "It's our ball!" multiple times the model didn't get it fully correct as it thought he was saying "It's on board" which I can see how it can mistaken it for that.

### Overall this was a cool and neat assignment to complete and debug along the way.
